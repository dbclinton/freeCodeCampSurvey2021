# freeCodeCampSurvey2021

Here's the Python code (jupyter Notebook) for reproducing the results and visualizations I report in my freeCodeCamp article. 
The original data is available on [GitHub](https://github.com/freeCodeCamp/2021-new-coder-survey) or [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/fccuser/2021-new-coder-survey).
